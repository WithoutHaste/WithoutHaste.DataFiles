========================
Naming

it's going to contain XmlDocument extensions, XmlDocument Ms excel 2003 operations, ExcelPackage extensions, and PdfSharp extensions
	- data file format extensions, in general

System.Data is for ADO.Net architecture - to manage data from multiple sources
	- don't want to conflict with this
System.Windows.DataFormats is an enum for data formats
	- not worried about conflicting with this
	
WithoutHaste.DataFormats

Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.DataFile
	seems to be the only use of "DataFile"

WithoutHaste.DataFiles
